# Local Heroes - Project Overview

## Description

**Local Heroes** is a local community volunteering portal that aims to bring together those who need assistance with day to day or specific tasks and those with the skills and time to help with those tasks. 

Jobs/task could include things such as shopping, cooking, cleaning, DIY or any other task/job a member of the local community would like help with. The focus of the site is on bringing communities together for the benefit of those who need help but also those who provide help.
